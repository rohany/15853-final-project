\maketitle

For our project, we propose to do an analysis of various I/O efficient
sorting algorithms.
%
We will examine both cache-aware algorithms and cache-oblivious algorithms
and perform an empirical comparison of the two.
%
To be more specific, we plan to implement the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Buffer trees, and a buffer tree insertion based sort.
\item K-way mergesort, as discussed in lecture.
\item Cache-oblivious sample sort, with the I/O efficient transpose operation.
\end{itemize}
We hope to examine the efficiency of these sorting algorithms by testing on data
that does not fit in different levels of the cache hierarchy, and test on data
that does not fit even within the L-3 cache, to test the difference between
cache and main memory.
%
Lastly, if it is possible we will test on data that does not even fit within main memory,
where flash or disk storage must be used.
